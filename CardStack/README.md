Cardstack is an Android app which creates and generated playing cards. The 
stack takes in 52 Card objects declared with a for loop, with 2 attributes.

Card attributes: int number and enum Suits

Card numbers range from 2-14. From 2-10, the Card's value will be 2-10, while 
11 = Jack, 12 = Queen, 13 = King, 14 = Ace.

The next card in the stack will appear when the user clicks on the screen. If 
the stack is empty, it will simply close program by using finish().
